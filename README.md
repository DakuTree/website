# website
Source for the front of my website: http://codeanimu.net

## how to build
(Using build/ as root dir)

1. RUN: "npm install" (Install grunt modules)
2. RUN: "grunt update"
3. RUN: "grunt dev" / "grunt prod"

## misc
The current site can be considered v1. It was built several years ago, and has only recently been updated to use grunt.
