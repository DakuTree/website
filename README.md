## README
This fork was made to allow easy customization of the free Bootstrap template "DEVELOPER" made by UX/UI designer [Xiaoying Riley](https://twitter.com/3rdwave_themes).  

Although this was made really for personal use, it should be easy enough for others to use as well.
Simply edit the .json files under build/files/config then run `grunt prod` in the build directory.
